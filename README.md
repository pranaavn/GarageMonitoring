# GarageMonitoring

Monitoring entrances to a house is key for safety. Most standard houses use alarm safety systems to check the status of doors that lead into the house. However, some entry points, such as garage doors, remain unmonitored. By identifying the pincode sent to open your garage, anyone else could gain entry into your home.

Using only a low-cost ESP Microprocessor and a bluetooth beacon, this project aims to solve this issue in an accessible way. This project has also been made scalable through the use of Docker container images for individual services.
